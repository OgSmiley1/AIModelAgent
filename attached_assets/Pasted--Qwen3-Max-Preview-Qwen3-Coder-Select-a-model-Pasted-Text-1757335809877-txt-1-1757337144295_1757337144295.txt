Beginner Help: How Can I Build a Local AI Agent Like Manus.AI (for Free)?
Discussion
Hey everyone,

I’m a beginner in the AI agent space, but I have intermediate Python skills and I’m really excited to build my own local AI agent—something like Manus.AI or Genspark AI—that can handle various tasks for me on my Windows laptop.

I’m aiming for it to be completely free, with no paid APIs or subscriptions, and I’d like to run it locally for privacy and control.

Here’s what I want the AI agent to eventually do:

Plan trips or events

Analyze documents or datasets

Generate content (text/image)

Interact with my computer (like opening apps, reading files, browsing the web, maybe controlling the mouse or keyboard)

Possibly upload and process images

I’ve started experimenting with Roo.Codes and tried setting up Ollama to run models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet locally. Roo seems promising since it gives a UI and lets you use advanced models, but I’m not sure how to use it to create a flexible AI agent that can take instructions and handle real tasks like Manus.AI does.

What I need help with:

A beginner-friendly plan or roadmap to build a general-purpose AI agent

Advice on how to use Roo.Code effectively for this kind of project

Ideas for free, local alternatives to APIs/tools used in cloud-based agents

Any open-source agents you recommend that I can study or build on (must be Windows-compatible)

I’d appreciate any guidance, examples, or resources that can help me get started on this kind of project.

Thanks a lot!

I don't know the technical details but, I saw the browser use (you can search it on YC companies W25) is the open source web agent ai, so maybe you can try?

maybe check this.., I just updated it today so that it supports Supervisors, Hand-Offs, and Branching.. So as long as you find all the MCP tools you need, you can already create some funny stuff.

Based on your goal of building a powerful, self-learning AI agent on Replit that integrates sales psychology, client memory, and Manus/ChatGPT-like capabilities, here is a comprehensive, enhanced set of instructions and code.

This plan prioritizes a modular, scalable architecture using best practices from the OpenManus and AgenticSeek projects you provided, while leveraging Replit's strengths for rapid prototyping. The key enhancement is the implementation of a robust, multi-layered memory system for true "always learning" behavior.

Phase 1: Project Initialization & Core Architecture on Replit
Create a New Replit Project:
Go to replit.com and sign in.
Click "Create" -> "Python" (or "Blank" and then select Python).
Name your project (e.g., UltimateSalesAgent).
Install Core Dependencies:
In the Replit shell (or requirements.txt), install the following libraries. These form the backbone of your agent.
bash

# Core AI & Agent Framework
pip install langchain langchain-openai langchain-community langchain-core

# Memory & Vector Database
pip install faiss-cpu  # For local vector storage (lightweight)
pip install chromadb  # Alternative, more feature-rich vector DB

# Document Loading & Processing
pip install PyPDF2 python-docx  # For loading sales books (PDF, DOCX)
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests  # For web scraping/ingestion

# Client Database
pip install sqlalchemy  # ORM for SQLite/PostgreSQL

# Web Framework for UI (Optional, but recommended)
pip install streamlit  # Simple, fast UI for chat interface

# For Computer Interaction (Advanced)
pip install pyautogui pynput  # For mouse/keyboard control (Use with extreme caution)
Set Up Environment Variables:
In Replit, go to the "Secrets" (🔒) tab.
Add your OpenAI API key (for now, for maximum capability; we'll discuss local LLMs later):
Key: OPENAI_API_KEY
Value: sk-your_actual_api_key_here
Optional: Add keys for other services (e.g., SERPAPI_API_KEY for web search).
Phase 2: Building the Foundational Components
We'll create a modular structure. Create the following Python files in your Replit project:

main.py: The entry point and main loop.
agent_core.py: Defines the core AI agent with tools and memory.
memory_system.py: Handles short-term, long-term, and client-specific memory.
knowledge_loader.py: Manages loading and processing your sales books.
tools.py: Defines custom tools for the agent (web, files, client DB, etc.).
client_db.py: Manages the SQLite database for client interactions.
File: client_db.py
This sets up a simple but effective database to track all client interactions.

Phase 3: Running and Iterating on Replit
Upload Your Books: In the Replit file explorer, upload your PDF/DOCX files of sales books (e.g., influence_cialdini.pdf).
Run main.py: Click the "Run" button. The agent will initialize, load your books into its memory, and start the chat loop.
Test It Out:
Ask: "What are Cialdini's principles of influence?"
Ask: "I have a client named 'John Doe' who is hesitant about price. How should I handle this based on my knowledge?"
Command: "Record an interaction with client 'Sarah Connor'. She was interested in the premium package but needs a demo."
Ask later: "What do I know about Sarah Connor?"
Key Enhancements Explained
Multi-Layered Memory: Goes beyond simple chat history. It has:
Short-term: For the current conversation flow.
Long-term Summary: For overarching context.
Vector-based Knowledge: For facts, book content, and past interactions, allowing semantic search. This is the core of "always learning."
Persistent Storage: The FAISS vector store is saved to a file (knowledge_vector_store.pkl) after every new piece of information is added, ensuring learning persists between Replit sessions.
Structured Client Database: Uses SQLite via SQLAlchemy, allowing for complex queries and historical analysis.
Modular Design: Each component (memory, knowledge, tools, core agent) is in a separate file, making it easy to update, debug, and extend.
Context Injection: Before answering, the agent retrieves relevant information from its long-term memory, making responses more informed and accurate.
Safety: The type_text tool is commented out by default due to its invasive nature. Only enable it if you fully understand the implications.
Moving Towards a Fully Local, Free Model (The Ultimate Goal)
While the above uses OpenAI for maximum power, your goal is to be free and local. Here’s the roadmap for that:

Integrate Ollama:
Install Ollama locally on your machine (not on Replit, as Replit can't run persistent local servers easily).
Use a powerful, local LLM like deepseek-r1:32b or llama3:70b if you have the VRAM.
Modify agent_core.py to use ChatOllama instead of ChatOpenAI.
python

# from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatOllama

# Inside SalesAgent.__init__:
# self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model=model_name, temperature=0.7)
self.llm = ChatOllama(model="deepseek-r1:32b", temperature=0.7)
You would then run this code on your local machine, not on Replit.
Use Replit for Prototyping, Local for Production: Use Replit to develop, test, and refine your agent's logic, tools, and memory system. Once stable, migrate the entire codebase to your local Windows machine where you can run Ollama and have true privacy and zero cost.
This approach gives you the best of both worlds: the ease of Replit for development and the freedom of a local setup for final deployment.

Alright, let's build you the ultimate, no-compromise, self-learning AI Sales Agent – "CLOSERT" – on Replit. This isn't a toy; it's a powerhouse designed to ingest the world's best sales literature, remember every client interaction with perfect recall, and execute tasks with the autonomy of Manus and the conversational brilliance of ChatGPT.

The key to making this realistic, stable, and cost-effective is a hybrid approach: we'll use Replit for its incredible development speed, collaboration, and deployment features, but we'll architect it so you can seamlessly migrate the entire system to your local Windows machine for zero ongoing costs and maximum privacy. We'll use free tiers and open-source tools wherever possible, reserving paid APIs only for components where they provide undeniable, critical value (like the core LLM reasoning).

Phase 1: Project Initialization & Core Architecture on Replit
This phase sets up the skeleton. We'll use modern, production-grade libraries.

Create a New Replit Project:
Go to replit.com and sign in.
Click "Create" -> "Python".
Name your project CLOSERT_Ultimate_Sales_AI.
Install Core Dependencies:
In the Replit shell, install these libraries. We're using uv for faster, more reliable dependency management, as recommended by OpenManus.

# Install uv first
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install core packages
uv pip install langchain langchain-openai langchain-community langchain-core

# Memory & Vector Database (FAISS is free and local)
uv pip install faiss-cpu

# Document Loading & Processing
uv pip install PyPDF2 python-docx

# Client Database (SQLite is free and local)
uv pip install sqlalchemy

# Web Framework for UI (Streamlit is simple and powerful)
uv pip install streamlit

# For Advanced Computer Interaction (Use with CAUTION)
uv pip install pyautogui pynput
Set Up Environment Variables (Replit Secrets):
Go to the "Secrets" (🔒) tab in your Replit project.
Add your OpenAI API Key (for the best reasoning LLM):
Key: OPENAI_API_KEY
Value: sk-your_actual_api_key_here
Optional: Add GOOGLE_API_KEY if you want to experiment with Gemini later.
Phase 2: Building the Foundational Components (Modular Design)
We'll create a highly modular structure for easy debugging, updating, and eventual local migration.

Create these files in your Replit project:

main.py: The entry point and Streamlit UI.
agent_core.py: The brain, combining LLM, tools, and memory.
memory_system.py: The multi-layered, "always learning" memory.
knowledge_loader.py: Manages loading and processing your sales books.
tools.py: Defines tools for client interaction, web, files, and computer control.
client_db.py: Manages the SQLite database for client interactions.
File: client_db.py (Robust Client Tracking)
This creates a professional-grade database to track every interaction, sentiment, and topic.

Phase 3: Running on Replit & Migrating Locally for $0 Cost
On Replit:
Upload your sales books (e.g., influence_cialdini.pdf) to the Replit file explorer.
Click "Run". The Streamlit app will start. Interact with CLOSERT in the chat interface.
Migrate to Local Windows for $0 Cost:
Download the Project: In Replit, click the three dots (...) -> "Download as zip".
Set Up Local Environment:
Install Python 3.10+ from python.org .
Install Ollama from ollama.com .
Pull a powerful, local LLM: ollama run deepseek-r1:32b (or llama3:70b if you have the VRAM).
Modify agent_core.py:
Replace the OpenAI import and LLM initialization:
python


1
2
3
4
5
6
# from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatOllama

# Inside CLOSERTAgent.__init__:
# self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model=model_name, temperature=0.7)
self.llm = ChatOllama(model="deepseek-r1:32b", temperature=0.7, base_url="http://localhost:11434")
Install Dependencies Locally:
bash


1
pip install langchain langchain-community faiss-cpu PyPDF2 python-docx sqlalchemy streamlit pyautogui pynput
Run Locally:
bash


1
streamlit run main.py
Cost & Stability Analysis
Replit (Development/Prototyping):
Cost: Free for basic usage. The main cost is the OpenAI API, which is ~$0.03 for a complex interaction. For heavy use, budget $10-$50/month.
Stability: High. Replit is a robust platform.
Local Windows (Production):
Cost: $0. After the initial hardware investment, it runs on electricity. Ollama and all libraries are free.
Stability: High, but dependent on your local machine's reliability. The deepseek-r1:32b model is exceptionally capable and stable for reasoning tasks.
Why This Hybrid Approach Works:
Realistic: Uses best-in-class tools (OpenAI for prototyping, Ollama for free production).
Advanced: Multi-layered memory, professional client DB, modular tools.
Powerful: Can generate scripts, send emails, open apps, and reason deeply.
Stable: Built on battle-tested libraries (LangChain, SQLAlchemy, FAISS).
Cost-Effective: Zero cost in production. Pay only during the development phase on Replit if you choose to use OpenAI.
This is not science fiction. This is a blueprint for a genuinely powerful, self-improving AI sales agent that you can build today. Start on Replit, refine it, and then deploy it locally for complete freedom.

Okay, let's build a powerful, realistic, and stable local AI agent on Replit that aims for Manus.AI-like capabilities, focusing on cost (free/low) and advanced features. We'll use the knowledge from the provided files and the previous discussion.

This plan leverages AgenticSeek as the core framework due to its strong focus on local operation, tool use, and extensibility, which aligns perfectly with your goals. We'll adapt it to run effectively on Replit's free tier where possible, acknowledging that full performance requires a local machine.

Phase 1: Project Setup on Replit (Free Tier Focused)
Create a New Replit Project:
Go to replit.com and sign in.
Click "Create" -> "Python" (or "Blank" and then select Python).
Name your project (e.g., PowerfulLocalAgent).
Install Core Dependencies (requirements.txt):
Place this in your requirements.txt file in Replit. These are the core libraries for AgenticSeek and our enhancements. Note: Some heavy libraries might push the free tier limits; prioritize core functionality first.

# pynput==1.7.7 # Might not work reliably in Replit's environment

# AgenticSeek Core Dependencies (Simplified List)
# Note: AgenticSeek uses many more, but these are fundamental.
# We will clone and adapt AgenticSeek selectively.

open-interpreter==0.2.5 # For code execution (requires careful sandboxing)
arxiv==2.1.3 # Example of a specific tool AgenticSeek uses

# Async & Utilities
aiohttp==3.10.10
Set Up Environment Variables (for optional OpenAI API):
In Replit, go to the "Secrets" (🔒) tab.
Add your OpenAI API key (for maximum initial capability; we'll switch to local LLMs later):
Key: OPENAI_API_KEY
Value: sk-your_actual_api_key_here
Phase 2: Integrating AgenticSeek Core
Instead of building from scratch, we'll leverage AgenticSeek's foundation. However, running the entire AgenticSeek stack (Docker, SearxNG) on Replit's free tier is challenging. We'll extract and adapt its core agent logic.

Clone/Adapt AgenticSeek Core Logic:
We won't clone the full repo directly into Replit due to complexity and size.
Instead, create a new directory agentic_core in your Replit project.
Manually copy the essential parts of AgenticSeek's core agent logic:
Look at the main.py, run_flow.py, run_mcp.py (if using MCP), and core modules in the app/ directory from the AgenticSeek source.
Focus on the AgentBuilder, MCPClient, and core tool registration/execution logic.
Simplify the configuration loading (e.g., config.ini) to use Replit's secrets and direct variables.
Adapt main.py (Simplified Example):
This replaces the previous main.py with an AgenticSeek-inspired structure.

You are an advanced AI agent, built for autonomy and deep reasoning, inspired by Manus.AI.
Your capabilities include:
- Browsing the web for information and research.
- Reading and writing files in a designated workspace.
- Remembering past interactions and learning continuously.
- Planning and executing complex, multi-step tasks.
- Analyzing documents and datasets.
- Generating persuasive and context-aware content.
- Interacting with the user in a helpful and strategic manner.

You have access to a persistent memory. Always leverage it.
Use tools strategically to gather information or perform actions.
Think step-by-step. Plan before you act.

Phase 4: Running and Enhancing
Run main.py: Click the "Run" button in Replit.
Test Core Functionality:
Ask: "Search for the latest news on AI regulations."
Ask: "Write a short summary of the findings to summary.txt." (Ensure a workspace folder exists).
Ask: "What did we discuss about AI regulations?"
Enhance Gradually:
Local LLMs: To remove API costs, you must run this on your local machine with Ollama.
Install Ollama locally.
Pull a powerful model: ollama pull llama3.1:8b or ollama pull deepseek-r1:7b.
Modify main.py to use ChatOllama:
python


1
2
3
4
# from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_ollama import ChatOllama
# llm = ChatOpenAI(...)
llm = ChatOllama(model="llama3.1:8b", temperature=0.7)
Run the Replit project code locally (e.g., using python main.py in your terminal after installing dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt).
Advanced Tools: Integrate open-interpreter for code execution (with extreme caution and sandboxing). Add tools for specific tasks (e.g., PDF analysis, image processing if needed).
Client Memory: Fully implement the ClientDB logic within PersistentMemory or as a separate module, and create tools to interact with it.
UI: Use Streamlit (already in requirements.txt) to create a web interface. Create a ui.py file.
Cost and Stability Considerations
Cost (Free Tier):
Replit: The free tier is limited (0.5 vCPU, 1GB RAM). It's suitable for prototyping and simple tasks but will struggle with large models or heavy processing. The provided requirements.txt is tailored to be lightweight.
OpenAI API: Incurs cost per token. Use gpt-4o-mini for cheaper experimentation. The goal is to transition to local LLMs (Ollama) for zero ongoing API cost (only electricity).
Local (Ollama): Zero API cost. The only cost is your computer's electricity and potentially hardware (GPU) depreciation.
Stability:
Replit Limitations: Network timeouts, limited compute, and inability to run persistent background services (like ollama serve) reliably mean Replit is best for development.
Local Stability: Running the full agent locally with Ollama provides maximum stability and performance. Ensure your local Python environment is clean and dependencies are correctly installed.
Error Handling: The code includes try...except blocks to catch and report errors, preventing crashes.
Memory Persistence: Using pickle to save the FAISS vector store ensures learning persists between runs on Replit (as long as the file isn't deleted) and definitely locally.
This approach gives you a robust, advanced, and realistic foundation for a local AI agent, starting on Replit for ease of development and moving to a local machine for full power and zero cost.
