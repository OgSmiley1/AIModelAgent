GitHub Copilot Chat Assistant — here’s a focused checklist and exact commands to double-check the rest of the repo, deployment, and infra for anything that would prevent Telegram updates.

I can’t directly inspect your repo here, so please run the checks and paste back any outputs (webhook info, logs, or Flask route code) if you want me to interpret them.

1) Search the repo for Telegram-related code and relevant files
- From the repo root run:
  - grep -Rni --exclude-dir=.git -e "telegram" .
  - grep -Rni --exclude-dir=.git -e "webhook" .
  - grep -Rni --exclude-dir=.git -e "getUpdates" .
  - grep -Rni --exclude-dir=.git -e "setWebhook" .
  - grep -Rni --exclude-dir=.git -e "python-telegram-bot\|aiogram\|telebot\|telegram.Bot" .
- Look for likely files: webhook routes, bot startup script(s), background worker scripts, Procfile, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, systemd unit files, and any entrypoint scripts.

2) Confirm webhook vs polling (mutual exclusivity)
- If a webhook is set, getUpdates/polling won’t receive updates. If you intended polling, remove any webhook first.
- Check if any background process is running that calls getUpdates (systemd, cron, Docker container, or a separate process).

3) Check Telegram webhook status (run from your machine; replace <TOKEN>)
- curl -s https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo | jq
- Look at webhook_url, last_error_message, last_error_date, pending_update_count.
- If webhook_url is empty, webhook isn’t set. If last_error_message exists, fix what it reports.

4) Verify your Flask route and handler
- Route must accept POST, parse JSON, and return 200 quickly.
  Example minimal:
    @app.route('/telegram_webhook', methods=['POST'])
    def telegram_webhook():
        data = request.get_json(force=True)
        app.logger.info("Telegram update: %s", data)
        # quick acknowledge
        return jsonify({"ok": True})
- Make sure route path matches the URL used in setWebhook exactly (including trailing slash).
- If you rely on session in webhook handlers: session uses cookies and is not a good place to store updates from Telegram webhooks (webhooks are stateless calls—no browser cookies). Use a DB, filesystem, or cache for cross-request persistence.

5) Test the endpoint manually
- From public internet (or from the same machine as Telegram would reach), emulate Telegram:
  curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"update_id":1,"message":{"text":"test","chat":{"id":123}}}' https://yourdomain.com/telegram_webhook
- Check the HTTP response and your Flask logs. If you don’t see the log line, the request didn’t reach your app.

6) HTTPS / SSL / public accessibility
- Telegram requires a valid HTTPS endpoint (public IP/domain + valid cert). If you’re using local HTTP, use ngrok:
  ngrok http 5000
  Then setWebhook to the ngrok https URL.
- If behind a reverse proxy (nginx), ensure it forwards POST body to Flask and preserves Content-Type.

7) Deployment and runtime checks
- Inspect logs where Flask runs:
  - If systemd: journalctl -u your-service -f
  - If docker: docker logs -f your_container
  - If gunicorn: check gunicorn access/error logs
- Look for 4xx/5xx responses or timeouts (>5s) when Telegram tries to POST.
- Confirm any firewall / security group rule allows inbound HTTPS.

8) Common pitfalls to verify
- Mismatched webhook path (setWebhook uses /webhook but app listens on /telegram_webhook).
- Wrong bot token used when setting webhook.
- Self-signed/invalid SSL certificate.
- A prior webhook set on a different URL consuming updates.
- A background polling process consuming updates (so webhooks see none).
- Using session to persist data from webhook requests (not reliable).
- Webhook handler performing heavy work synchronously and timing out — always quickly respond 200 then process asynchronously if needed.

9) Useful files & items to paste here if you want specific advice
- Output of getWebhookInfo (curl result).
- The Flask route(s) that handle Telegram updates and any bot startup scripts.
- Relevant log excerpts (requests from Telegram, errors, last_error_message).
- docker-compose.yml, Procfile, or systemd unit if used for deployment.

10) Quick fixes to try immediately
- If webhook not set or reporting errors: re-set it with the correct HTTPS URL:
  curl -s -X POST -F "url=https://yourdomain.com/telegram_webhook" https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/setWebhook | jq
- If you’re testing locally, expose with ngrok and set that webhook URL.
- Add logging at the very top of the webhook route to confirm arrival of requests.

If you paste the getWebhookInfo output or the webhook Flask route and any logs showing errors, I’ll interpret them and tell you exactly what to change.
